## Reporting a vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in this project, please report it responsibly:

- **Do not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.
- Email the maintainer(s) or open a private security advisory on GitHub (Repository → Security → Advisories → New draft) so the issue can be addressed before disclosure.

We will acknowledge your report and work on a fix. Thank you for helping keep this project safe.
